# projectForCats

This project was designed for a json server, the catfact.ninja I used list of cats and breeds and instead of using them as the api I used a json to not bother them with my requests and also because i wasnt sure if they have a request limit or will need a key after a certain amount so this was the most stable way.


This was made so you put a cat breed into the box and it returns your breed, origin, country its from, the coat and pattern if any.

light and dark mode are for the users eyes and i have it default to darkmode due to personal preference!
